# About fastapi project templates

Each fastapi demo project in this folder is pasted to the user's local folder with the FastAPI-fastkit replication as the source code is.

For those with experience in developing Django, it is easy to understand that it performs a similar operation to the `$ django-admin start project mysite` cli-operation.

All source codes in demo projects must consist of **`.py-tpl`**, _not_ .py.

## Base structure of FastAPI template project

(TODO : add description about -> include "FastAPI-fastkit" in setup.py)
