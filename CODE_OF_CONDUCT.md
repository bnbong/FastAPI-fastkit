# COCDE OF CONDUCT of FastAPI-fastkit

## Significance of FastAPI-fastkit project

- For those new to FastAPI and Python, this project makes it easy and quick to configure a Python-based web app development environment.
- Users may use a configuration that may increase the efficiency of development from an object-oriented-like perspective by adding framework attributes to an informal FastAPI code.
- Users can quickly boot up development configurations that meet their requirements by selecting various project templates from various projects.

## Responsibility of providing FastAPI-based template

Some of the FastAPI-based template project's dependencies will include projects that have just been created. 
And we want to keep most of the dependencies up to date.

The reason for this is that this project is not meant to be a stable and lightweight project. 
This project is focused solely on the purpose of making it easier for new users of Python and FastAPI to adapt to this ecosystem.

However, for a user's best experience, each dependency must be organically connected and reducing its viability is also very important.

The right to maintain this is the responsibility of the project owner [bnbong](mailto:bbbong9@gmail.com) and the contributors who contribute to this project.
