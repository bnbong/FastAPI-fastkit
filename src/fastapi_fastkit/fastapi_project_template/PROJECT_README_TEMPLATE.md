# Origin of this project

The source of this project was created based on the template of the [FastAPI-fastkit](https://github.com/bnbong/FastAPI-fastkit) project.

The `FastAPI-fastkit` project is an open-source project that allows users who are new to Python and FastAPI to quickly set up a FastAPI-based application development environment in a framework-like format.

Thank you for your interest in and use of our software.
