# CONTRIBUTING of FastAPI-fastkit

It is highly desirable to improve the project to provide better access for users who are new to Python and FastAPI.

Highly appreciate it for your interesting in this project and for your contribution by investing your precious time.

Before contributing to this open source, I strongly recommend that you read the
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) files to understand
the direction of this project and the precautions for cooperation.

### Milestone of FastAPI-fastkit

Before get started, you'd better take a look at [MILESTONE](https://github.com/bnbong/FastAPI-fastkit/discussions/2) of this project.

To provide good productivity and quality service, I opened the source code for this project, but the direction of the project must be properly and firmly to provide a good user experience, leaving a milestone for the project officially.

This document will also be a good indicator for you to gain insight into the direction of this project's contribution.

README.md writing guide(using [PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md](fastapi-project-template/PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md) template), foldering, other third party config, etc...)

## Additional note

If you look at source codes, you will see a commentary at the top of the module that describes about the module.

In that section, I have my information as the manager of this project as author, but that doesn't mean I'm the only one who can modify the module.

I emphasize that the reason I left my information in the comment section is to specify the information about the project's final director and not to increase the barriers to entry into the open source contribution of other contributors.

**However**, I would like to inform you that I have only the right to modify the document file itself such as .md file.

If the contribution to the project includes the contribution to the document, there is a possibility that PR will be rejected.
