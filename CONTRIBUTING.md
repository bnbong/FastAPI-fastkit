# CONTRIBUTING of FastAPI-fastkit

It is highly desirable to improve the project to provide better access for users who are new to Python and FastAPI.

Highly appreciate it for your interesting in this project and for your contribution by investing your precious time.

## Setting up Environment

FastAPI-fastkit's default project template uses following stacks:

- Python 3.12.4
- FastAPI 0.115.0
- Uvicorn 0.31.0
- PostgreSQL 17 (Dockerized)
- Docker (stable version)
- alembic 1.13.3
- SQLModel 0.0.22
- fastapi-cli 0.0.5

### Why using these stacks?

Some of the dependencies include projects that have just been created. And we want to keep most of the dependencies up to date.

The reason for this is that this project is not meant to be a stable and lightweight project. 
This project is focused solely on the purpose of making it easier for new users of Python and FastAPI to adapt to this ecosystem.

However, for a user's best experience, each dependency must be organically connected and reducing its viability is also very important.

The right to maintain this is the responsibility of the project owner [bnbong](mailto:bbbong9@gmail.com) and the contributors who contribute to this project. 

In this regard, the details that should be noted when contributing to this open source project are specified in more detail in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) files.
