This project was created to speed up the configuration of the development environment needed to develop Python-based web apps for new users of Python and [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi).

This project was inspired by the `SpringBoot initializer` & Python Django's `django-admin` cli operation.

## Key Features

- **⚡ Immediate FastAPI project creation** : Super-fast FastAPI workspace & project creation via CLI, inspired by `django-admin` feature of [Python Django](https://github.com/django/django)
- **🎨 Prettier CLI outputs** : Beautiful CLI experience powered by [rich library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
- **📋 Standards-based FastAPI project templates** : All FastAPI-fastkit templates are based on Python standards and FastAPI's common use patterns
- **🔍 Automated template quality assurance** : Weekly automated testing ensures all templates remain functional and up-to-date
- **🚀 Multiple project templates** : Choose from various pre-configured templates for different use cases (async CRUD, Docker, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **📦 Multiple package manager support** : Choose your preferred Python package manager (pip, uv, pdm, poetry) for dependency management

## Installation

## Significance of FastAPI-fastkit

FastAPI-fastkit aims to provide a fast and easy-to-use starter kit for new users of Python and FastAPI.

This idea was initiated with the aim of helping FastAPI newcomers learn from the beginning, which aligns with the production significance of the FastAPI-cli package added with the [FastAPI 0.111.0 version update](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/releases/tag/0.111.0).

As someone who has been using and loving FastAPI for a long time, I wanted to develop a project that could help fulfill [the wonderful motivation](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/pull/11522#issuecomment-2264639417) that FastAPI developer [tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) has expressed.

FastAPI-fastkit bridges the gap between getting started and building production-ready applications by providing:

- **Immediate productivity** for newcomers who might be overwhelmed by setup complexity
- **Best practices** built into every template, helping users learn proper FastAPI patterns
- **Scalable foundations** that grow with users as they advance from beginners to experts
- **Community-driven templates** that reflect real-world FastAPI usage patterns
